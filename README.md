# Web-Design-Challenge

This repo contains a visualization dashboard website using visualizations of weather data. The dashboard will have individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
